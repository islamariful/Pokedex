# Pokedex
## A pokedex app built and optimized for iOS to keep track of Caught Pokemon
Please do not copy this code and submit this as your own for the CS50 Problemset.

Instead, use this as a guide and try to understand the code. This way if you run into a problem, you'll have a working understanding and know how to solve it.

This is simply one iteration of how a Pokedex can be madeâ€“if you notice any inefficiencies and/or have a better way to get to the same reasult, please let me know. Any feedback on how to improve is appreciated!

The API used in this is from: https://pokeapi.co/
There are multiple other data-sets and keys to work with; if you want to implement more features, feel free to explore the API and make your own Pokedex!
